### Electronics
A lot of effort is put into teaching circuit design theory. What doesn't get directly gets covered is how to prototype, physically design (PCB-layout), soldering and testing out the circuits in practice. 
#### Tools
##### Test tools
* Multimeter: One of the most basic tools for the engineer wishing to test and make circuits. A multimeter usually allows for measuring voltage, current and resistance. Better multimeters allow measuring of Capacitance and Inductances.
* Lab power supply: Usually testing with battery or wall plug supplys don't quite cover it when testing. Lab power supplies provide a usually fixed or variable voltage, with some output current limiting. The voltage output of the supply is usually of very high quality with regards to noise, which is great for testing.
* Oscilloscope
* Frequency generators(Function generator)
* Probes
##### Tools for making circuits
* Breadboard
* Strip board
* Perf board
* Soldering Iron: In general soldering is seen as a type of just get it done job, but properly treating and maintining a soldering iron will give much better result. The key to soldering is getting the joint clean, lightly brushing the copper area will remove some oxidation, rubbing alcohol will remove fats and oils from the area. Then covering the joint in some flux, usually by flux pen. The next thing is soldering iron, the solder tip has to be fit for the job being done, usually the pointy tips don't quite work as for all task, as they are general purpose. The key to getting great joints with through hole components is to use a flat tip, like this[john gammel youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b15MMzb_GWw). Surface mount components such as BGA (Ball grid array) and QFN package components are almost impossible to solder by hand, so using a reflow oven or heat gun is recommended. Surface mount components such as QFP and packages with actually component leads are possible to solder with the right cleaning, flux, properly maintained soldering iron, and a steady hand. If the application calls for SMD then try limiting to components with leads.
