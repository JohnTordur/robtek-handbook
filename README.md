# The handbook
A hand book for everyone studying for a bachelors degree in Robotics at SDU.
We wish to collect good materials, links to good sources for learning and other related projects and subject that might be covered in courses offered. 
## Purpose
This handbook was made as to supplement, and improve your studying experience at SDU. We believe that people are different, and learn differently, and as such might not always learn optimally given the lecture format of some courses. We want to try and change that by removing some of the frustration associated with learning some of the more difficult topics, and associated topics not directly thought. 
## Disclaimer
This handbook is not endorsed by SDU officially, and as the materials, guides, and tips is used at the student/users own responsibilty. Any complaints about the education, exams or any institution specific problem should not be directed at this project.
